LC 1177 -> Can Make Palindrome from Substring
sol -> 2D hashing prefix


GOOD PROB
LC 1915 -> Number of Wonderful Substrings
wonderful subs is a string where the substring has at most one odd character
another variation for the problem could be a wonderful subs is a string in which each characters of the substring occurs even number of times.
sol -> counting even and odd occurances and storing in map
